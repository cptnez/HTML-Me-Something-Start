     <h1>The Journey So Far...</h1>
     <main class="boxPlatinum">
       My journey with coding has been both trying and satisfying during this first season of getting knee deep in code.
       I have had the opportunity to join the program <em>LaunchCode</em> which has helped me in more ways than I thought possible.
       On my own I was only able to pull together a handful of projects, all while pulling my hair out. Now I have the chance to
       learn under skilled instructors, to colaborate with other students, and to put my skills to the test in a controlled environment.
