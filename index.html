     <h1>The Journey So Far...</h1>
     <main class="boxPlatinum funParagraph">
       My journey with coding has been both trying and satisfying during this first season of getting knee deep in code.
       I have had the opportunity to join the program <em>LaunchCode</em> which has helped me in more ways than I thought possible.
       On my own I was only able to pull together a handful of projects, all while pulling my hair out. Now I have the chance to
       learn under skilled instructors, to colaborate with other students, and to put my skills to the test in a controlled environment.

     <h1>The Big Why</h1>

       When starting a new chapter like this, I try to ask 'The Big Why'. This gives me the direction I need to check myself before I 
       potentially make a wrong move. <em>'The Big Why' for this season is to pursue a carrer in web development in order to provide for 
        my family and to allow me to continue my work as a minister of Jesus Christ. 
       </em>
       This simple statement gives me the reason to keep on coding late at night, to wake up early to do my reading for class, and to push
       my code time after time to make sure I'm on track with my assignments.

     <h2 id="boxPlatinum">Carrer Goals</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>To find a position that is both rewarding and challenging</li>
       <li>To be able to provide for my family including my wife and four children</li>
       <li>To be able to find a work/life balance</li>
